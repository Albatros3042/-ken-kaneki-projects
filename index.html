        Tokyo Ghoul is set in an alternate reality where ghouls, creatures that
        look like normal people but can only survive by eating human flesh, live
        among the human population in secrecy, hiding their true nature in order
        to evade pursuit from the authorities. Ghouls have powers including
        enhanced strength and regenerative abilities - a regular ghoul produces
        4–7 times more kinetic energy in their muscles than a normal human; they
        also have several times the RC cells, a cell that flows like blood and
        can become solid instantly. A ghoul's skin is resistant to ordinary
        piercing weapons, and it has at least one special predatory organ called
        a kagune (Japanese: 赫子), which it can manifest and use as a weapon
        during combat. Another distinctive trait of ghouls is that when they are
        excited or hungry, the color of their sclera in both eyes turns black
        and their irises red. This mutation is known as kakugan (赫眼, "red
        eye"). A half-ghoul can either be born naturally as a ghoul and a
        human's offspring, or artificially created by transplanting some ghoul
        organs into a human. In both cases, a half-ghoul is usually much
        stronger than a pure-blood ghoul. In the case of a half-ghoul, only one
        of the eyes undergoes the "red eye" transformation. Natural born
        half-ghouls are very rare, and creating half-ghouls artificially
        initially has a low success rate. There is also the case of half-humans,
        hybrids of ghouls and humans that can feed like normal humans and lack a
        Kagune while possessing enhanced abilities, like increased speed and
        reaction speed, but shortened lifespans. Naturally born half-ghouls can
        also eat like normal humans or full ghouls. The story follows Ken
        Kaneki, a student who barely survives a deadly encounter with Rize
        Kamishiro, his date who reveals herself as a ghoul and tries to eat him.
        He is taken to the hospital in critical condition. After recovering,
        Kaneki discovers that he underwent a surgery that transformed him into a
        half-ghoul. This was accomplished because some of Rize's organs were
        transferred into his body, and now, like normal ghouls, he must consume
        human flesh to survive. Ghouls who run a coffee shop called "Anteiku"
        (あんていく) take him in and teach him to deal with his new life as a
        half-ghoul. Some of his daily struggles include fitting into the ghoul
        society, as well as keeping his identity hidden from his human
        companions, especially from his best friend, Hideyoshi Nagachika. The
        prequel series Tokyo Ghoul [Jack] follows the youths of Kishō Arima and
        Taishi Fura, two characters from the main series who become acquainted
        when they join forces to investigate the death of Taishi's friend at the
        hands of a ghoul, leading to Taishi eventually following Arima's path
        and joining the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), the federal agency
        tasked into dealing with crimes related to ghouls as well. The sequel
        series Tokyo Ghoul:re follows an amnesiac Kaneki under the new identity
        of Haise Sasaki (the result of horrific brain damage sustained from
        Kishō Arima). He is the mentor of a special team of CCG investigators
        called "Quinx Squad" that underwent a similar procedure as his, allowing
        them to obtain the special abilities of Ghouls in order to fight them
        but still being able to live as normal humans.
